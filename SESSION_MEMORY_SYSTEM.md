# 🔄 Session Memory System Documentation

## Overview

The SHCI Voice Assistant now features a **robust session-based memory system** that maintains conversation context across page reloads, browser stops, and temporary disconnections. Users can now have continuous conversations without losing context, even if they reload the page or temporarily close the browser.

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ **Persistent Session Memory**
- **Cross-Reload Persistence**: Memory survives page reloads and browser refreshes
- **20-Minute Session Timeout**: Conversations persist for 20 minutes of inactivity
- **Automatic Session Management**: No user authentication required
- **Connection-Based Sessions**: Each browser connection gets a unique session

### ✅ **Smart Session Handling**
- **Welcome Back Messages**: AI remembers previous conversations
- **Topic Continuity**: References past discussion topics
- **User Recognition**: Remembers user name and preferences
- **Context Preservation**: Full conversation history maintained

### ✅ **Session Management**
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired sessions are automatically cleaned up
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient memory management prevents overflow
- **Session Statistics**: Real-time session monitoring
- **Error Recovery**: Memory saved even on connection errors

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Session Service**
```python
class SessionService:
    def create_session(connection_id: str) -> str
    def get_session(session_id: str) -> Optional[Dict]
    def load_session_memory(session_id: str) -> Optional[SessionMemory]
    def save_session_memory(session_id: str, memory: SessionMemory) -> bool
    def is_session_active(session_id: str) -> bool
    def cleanup_expired_sessions()
```

### **Session Lifecycle**
```
1. User opens browser → Create/Get session
2. User starts conversation → Load existing memory
3. User reloads page → Same session, same memory
4. User closes browser → Memory saved, session remains active
5. User returns within 20min → Welcome back with context
6. 20min inactivity → Session expires, memory cleaned up
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **1. Session Creation**
- **Unique Session ID**: `session_{connection_id}_{timestamp}`
- **Connection Mapping**: Each browser connection gets a session
- **Memory Loading**: Automatically loads existing conversation history
- **Welcome Back**: Detects returning users and greets them

### **2. Memory Persistence**
- **Database Storage**: SQLite-based persistent storage
- **Automatic Saving**: Saves memory every 30 seconds
- **Error Recovery**: Saves memory even on connection errors
- **Cross-Session**: Memory persists across browser sessions

### **3. Session Timeout**
- **20-Minute Timeout**: Sessions expire after 20 minutes of inactivity
- **Activity Tracking**: Updates on every user interaction
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired sessions are cleaned up every 5 minutes
- **Memory Preservation**: Conversation history is preserved until timeout

## 📊 Session Statistics

The system tracks comprehensive session statistics:

- **Active Sessions**: Number of currently active sessions
- **Total Sessions**: Total number of sessions created
- **Total Interactions**: Sum of all conversation interactions
- **Session Timeout**: Current timeout setting (1200 seconds)
- **Last Cleanup**: When sessions were last cleaned up

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **1. New User Experience**
```
User opens browser → "Hello! I'm SHCI, your voice assistant. How can I help you?"
User: "Hi, I'm John. I want to learn Python."
AI: "Hello John! I'd be happy to help you learn Python. What would you like to start with?"
```

### **2. Returning User Experience**
```
User reloads page → "Welcome back! I remember our conversation about Python programming. How can I help you today?"
User: "What about machine learning?"
AI: "Since you're interested in Python, machine learning is perfect! Python has excellent libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch..."
```

### **3. Session Continuity**
```
User: "Can you explain supervised learning?"
AI: "Sure! Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn patterns. Remember when we discussed Python? You can implement supervised learning using scikit-learn..."
```

## 🔍 API Endpoints

### **Session Statistics**
```bash
GET /health/session-stats
```
Returns current session statistics and system health.

### **Memory Management**
```bash
GET /memory/conversation/{session_id}
GET /memory/conversation/{session_id}/summary
GET /memory/conversation/{session_id}/topics
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
cd fastapi-backend
python test_session_persistence.py
```

This tests:
- Session creation and management
- Memory persistence across reloads
- Conversation context preservation
- Topic tracking and user preferences
- Session timeout and cleanup
- Memory retrieval and continuation

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

## 🔧 Configuration

Session settings can be configured in `SessionService`:

```python
self.session_timeout = 1200  # 20 minutes
self.cleanup_interval = 300  # 5 minutes
```

Memory settings in `SessionMemory`:

```python
self.max_conversation_history = 50  # Maximum conversation turns
self.max_context_length = 1000      # Maximum context length for LLM
```

## 🎉 Real-World Scenarios

User: "Tell me about machine learning"
AI: "Machine learning is a subset of AI..."
[20+ minute conversation continues]
[User reloads after 25 minutes]
AI: "Welcome back! We were discussing machine learning algorithms. You were particularly interested in neural networks. Shall we continue?"
```
